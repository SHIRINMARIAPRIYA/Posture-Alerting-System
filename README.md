# Posture-Alerting-System
## Abstract
The Posture Alerting System aims to address the health issues caused by prolonged sitting and poor posture, such as back pain, muscle strain, and spinal disorders. The system uses an Arduino-based device that alerts users (employees, home workers, etc.) when they maintain poor posture for too long. This gadget provides feedback using an IR sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer.

## Problem & Significance
Employees, especially those in IT offices, experience prolonged sitting in front of computers, leading to various posture-related issues like kyphosis, back pain, and muscle stiffness. Our goal is to develop a solution to remind employees to correct their posture or take breaks, thus improving their overall health.

## Introduction
The Posture Detector System is an innovative approach to improving workplace ergonomics. Using Arduino technology, the system detects poor posture and notifies the user through a buzzer sound.

## System Design
The system includes:

IR Sensor: Detects the presence of the person.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance between the user and the system, monitoring posture.

Buzzer: Emits a sound when the user has been in a poor posture for too long.

## Application & Results
Application: This system is particularly useful in office environments where employees spend long hours sitting. It can also be used by individuals working from home.

Results: The product alerts users to improve posture and stretches, leading to a healthier lifestyle.

## Future Scope
In the future, the system could be enhanced to:

Track the time spent in poor posture.

Provide more personalized feedback (e.g., voice prompts).

Integrate with other wellness devices to create a complete health monitoring system.
